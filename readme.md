1. Which are the 5 countries with the highest and lowest rates of increase in obesity rates between 1975 and 2016 (period studied).
2. Which countries have the highest and lowest obesity rates in 2015?
3. What is the mean percentage difference in obesity between genders over the years in relation to world/Brazil?

## Some technical details:
- This data analysis was produced by combining native Python themes with functions from the Pandas library.
- In some cells we will display NaN - which means empty.
